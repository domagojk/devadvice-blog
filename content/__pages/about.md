# About me

My name is Domagoj Kriskovic and I'm a senior software engineer and consultant.

I've started working with web technologies in 2003. and created my first "bigger" app (a platform for sharing videos) 2005.

I was a lead frontend developer in a startup called "Codeanywhere" and had built a good portion of the [online editor](https://codeanywhere.com/features/editor) which is used there.

Over the last two years, I've been working as a consultant with main focus on the overall architecture built primarily using AWS services.
